1. Passing message between JSP and Servlet
If you insist to use redirect instead of forward, then you have 2 options:

    1. Pass the message as request parameter
    
	    String message = "hello";
		res.sendRedirect("adminHome.jsp?message=" + URLEncoder.encode(message, "UTF-8"));
	
	so that you can display it in JSP as follows
	
		<p>Message: ${param.message}</p>

	It's only visible in the browser address bar as well and you aren't able to pass non-standard Java objects this way.

	2. Store it in session
		String message = "hello";
		req.getSession().setAttribute("message", message);
		res.sendRedirect("adminHome.jsp");

	so that you can display (and remove) it in JSP as follows:

		<p>Message: ${message}</p>
		<c:remove var="message" scope="session" /> 

	Removing is important, otherwise it sticks there for the entire session.

However, if you're open to using forward instead of redirect, it's more elegant:

	String message = "hello";
	req.setAttribute("message", message);
	req.getRequestDispatcher("/adminHome.jsp").forward(req, res);

and display it as follows in JSP

    <p>Message: ${message}</p>
